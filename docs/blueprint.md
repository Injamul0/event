# **App Name**: ClubHub

## Core Features:

- Event Listing and RSVP: Allow users to browse listed events, view details, and RSVP for events, and get reminded as needed.
- Search and Filter: Enable users to quickly find relevant events based on keywords, date, and category. Implement a filter option that appears automatically only if a minimum number of events are created.
- Admin Dashboard: A protected area with features for event and user management, and viewing key engagement analytics.
- Automated Summaries: Provide users a tool that, when viewing details about an event, can get a short, generative-AI powered summary of user reviews of the event.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dusty Rose (#C4A484), a muted color to promote a feeling of community and nostalgia, aligning with club themes.
- Background color: Off-White (#F5F5DC), to provide a creamy backdrop that complements the primary color.
- Accent color: Muted Blue (#607B8B), selected as a contrasting accent to the primary and background, providing visual interest without overwhelming the creamy color scheme.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', serif. Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif. A pairing to project an elegant and contemporary impression. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Incorporate parallax scrolling effects and subtle 3D elements to enhance the user experience and create a sense of depth.
- Employ clear, intuitive icons for event categories and user actions to facilitate easy navigation.
- Use gentle animations for transitions and loading states to provide smooth feedback and improve user engagement.
